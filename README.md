## Usage
Using this project is super easy, once you are the website, you will see the hompage displaying all the posts. Clicking on any other link or button on the site will redirect you to the login/signup page. Once you are logged in, you are now able to view posts and comment on them as you please as well as create a new post. All of this information is stored in a database.
